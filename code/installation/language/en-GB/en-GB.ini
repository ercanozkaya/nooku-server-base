TIPCOLLATIONNONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL does not have UTF-8 support, which is the required encoding.</p><p>It is recommended that you upgrade your database to a version newer than 4.1.2. If this is not possible, Nooku Server will store UTF-8 encoded content in your existing database in a backward compatibe mode. Collation selection is not possible in this mode and a default collation will be used.</p>
TIPCOLLATIONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL includes UTF-8 support, which is the required encoding.</p><p>Choose a collation from the list. If none appears for your language, the default collation <em>utf8_general_ci</em> is suitable.</p>
TIPCONFSTEPS=<br />Enter your e-mail address. This will be the e-mail address of the Web site Super Administrator.<br />Enter a new password and then confirm it in the appropriate fields. Along with the username <strong>admin</strong>, this will be the password that you will use to login to the Administrator Control Panel at the end of the installation.<br /> If you are migrating, you can ignore this section. Your current settings will be automatically migrated.
TIPDATABASE=Some hosting providers allow only a specific database name per account. If this is the case with your setup, use the table prefix option in the Advanced Settings section below to differentiate more than one Nooku Server site.
TIPDATABASESTEPS=<p>Setting up Nooku Server to run on your server involves four easy steps.</p>	<p>The first step is database configuration. Choose your preferred settings: </p><h2>Basic Settings</h2><p>Select the type of database from the drop down list. This will generally be <strong>MySQL</strong>.</p>	<p>Enter the hostname of the database server Nooku Server will be installed on. This may not necessarily be the same as your Web server so check with your hosting provider if you are not sure.</p>\n		<p>Enter the MySQL username, password and database name you wish to use with Nooku Server. These must already exist for the database you are going to use.</p><h2>Advanced Settings</h2>	<p> Select how to handle existing tables from a previous installation.</p><p>Enter a table prefix to be used for this Nooku Server installation.</p>
TIPFTPCONFSTEPS=<p>Due to file system permission restrictions on Linux and other Unix systems (and PHP Safe Mode restrictions), an FTP layer is used to handle file system manipulation and enable Nooku Server installers.<br /><br />Enter an FTP username and password with access to the Nooku Server root directory. This will be the FTP account that handles all file system operations when Nooku Server requires FTP access to complete a task.<br /><br />For security reasons and if the option is available, it is best to create a separate FTP user account with access to the Nooku Server installation only and not the entire Web server.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you are installing on a Windows Operating System, the FTP layer is <b>not</b> required.
TIPHOST=This is usually <strong>localhost</strong> or a host name provided by the hosting provider.
TIPINSTALLDEFAULT=Installing sample data is strongly recommended for beginners. This will install sample content that is included in the Nooku Server installation package.
TIPLOADMIGRATION=The migration script needs to be created on the old site by the <code>com_migrator</code> tool to conform. Enter the table prefix of the old site and enter the encoding used in old site (_ISO setting in language file or as seen in browser info/encoding/source).
TIPUPLOADED=I have already uploaded the migration script to the server (e.g. via FTP/SCP)
TIPMIGRATION=This script is a Nooku Server 1.0 migration script.
TIPLOADSQL=Nooku Server migration SQL scripts need to be Joomla 1.5.x compatible and should have the appropriate table prefix.
TIPPASSWORD=Using a password for the MySQL account is mandatory for site security. This is the same password used to access your database. This may be predefined by your hosting provider.
TIPPREFIX=Do not use the prefix 'bak_'. This is used for backup tables.
TIPPREINSTALL=If any of these items are not supported (marked as <strong><font color="#ff0000">No</font></strong>), your system does not meet the minimum requirements for installation. Please take appropriate actions to correct the errors. Failure to do so could lead to your Nooku Server installation not functioning properly.
TIPRECOMSETTINGS=These are the recommended settings for PHP in order to ensure full compatibility with Nooku Server.<br />\nNooku Server will still operate even if your settings do not match.
TIPUSER=This can be the default MySQL username <strong>root</strong>, a username provided by your hosting provider, or one that you created in setting up your database server.
TIPXML=Use for testing install of other database platforms
TOOMANYLINES=At this point, the current query includes more than %s dump lines. This most likely due to a large content item or perhaps a forum post.
